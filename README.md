# unreal_sandbox

# Overview
This is an Unreal project created to be the sandbox for creating new unreal plugins. This project will allow us to have an environment for testing new plugins. The plugins themselves should contain **little to no** demos of their functionality. Instead the demos and integrations of the plugin should be created in this project. This will help keep the plugins light weight while providing a save environment for them to be learned and modified.
